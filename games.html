  <p>This is a game from 2017 december and is still updated today. I myself started playing it back in 2018 January, where I would have lots of fun with the gameplay (even though its just collecting snow and ice). The game has backpacks, tools, vehicles, pets and special monthly items. Somewhere between 2024-2025 it was remodeled and now looks more detailed - stuff is more round now.</p>

  <p>Lumber Tycoon 2 is an absolute classic. In this game you can drive a few vehicles, build anything you want (but it costs wood) and find secrets, like axes. Also travel - I could be wrong but this game has 3 separate islands, where you would have to pay in-game cash for trips. I like the game's music, because it just feels relaxing, it feels like old Roblox. One downside in Lumber Tycoon 2 are the bugs - they are the worst. I have lost much progress in the game because of how glitchy this game really is. Maybe its also something that makes the experience more popular, but in my opinion I do not like the bugs. However its a cool nostalgic game - an easy 8.5/10 for me.</p>

    <p>Another simulator created in 2018. As the name of the game says, its all about breaking things, specifically parts. You equip a weapon, backpack, bomb and go to a world, where you take your rocket launcher and blast things. Simple, yet fun experience. Over the years, the game hasn't been updated so much, just a few more levels and more rebirths.</p>

    <p>Mining Simulator is another 2018 game, which blew the freak up when it came out. The goal is simple - dig, buy new tools, own pets and accessories that give more power, unlock new worlds and do rebirths. If you are starting out this game without any help, I'll tell you that it's little bit grindy, but I guess afterwards it becomes much easier. I did start playing Mining Sim. when it was released and I had loads of fun with it, and I can say it hasn't been changed much at all, so thumbs up for this game.</p>

    <p>As of 2025, this game has 40k active players and it kind of deserves it. I like the game's layout and design - truly makes you feel like you are in a bee world. You need to get bees, upgrade to new weapons, unlock new areas and defeat bosses. It also has like a special item system, which you get from quests and from collecting pollen. For me the experience got too grindy, so thats why I stopped playing for a while. Though, I still occasionally come back to this game - its like a ritual to visit this game. Bee Swarm Simulator is also responsible for creating the Stickbug meme - absolute gem.</p>

    <p>One of the most popular disaster games on Roblox is NDS, with the daily player count over 10k+ (as of 2025). The game never died, because people kept making videos about it and they blew up - its like an easy view tool if you are starting of YouTube. Also, people are keeping this game alive because its simply funny and runs on low-end devices.

    <p>If you don't know CHAIN, I will tell ya. CHAIN is a horror game, where it has modes likes survival and story. In story mode there are different missions you have to pass, while a Jason Voorhes-like character is trying to unalive you. In survival mode you are in a forest-like world, where you just have to survive the night with this serial killer. Now, I haven't played this in a longgg time, but as I remember, the story was something like the killer is a demon and got summoned via a ritual.</p>

    <p>This is a meme-like experience which you might have never of. The game "when the" is exactly like Natural Disaster survival, but instead of having normal disaster maps, this one takes it to a new level. It has disasters like terrorist attack, overpowered lighting, growing mold and whatever more you can imagine. When I played it, I found lots of humorous people, and this is what makes it even better. Its a meme spot in a nutshell.</p>

So if you want to crank up your Natural Disaster Survival difficulty, play Survival Disaster Natural.</p>

    <p>Imo one of the best vehicle games on Roblox. I got addicted to the game about 4 years ago and ended up having real life problems because of it (litteraly). The game is really pulling you in if you like vehicles and crashes, which this game does really well. It has hundreds cars to choose, but you have to unlock them first. The map lately got expanded and its big now. CC2 was originally about these crusher machines (which still exist), but people had more fun breaking the cars outside of these grinders. So this experience gained popularity. For me its a 9.5/10</p>

    <p>Shipping Lanes is about traveling with ships. Your task in the game is to pick up containers and deliver them into other place. I like the game, because theres something beautiful about it - its simply the sailing. The traveling gets little bit boring, but also most of the time the gameplay can be relaxing, which is art. If you are into ships, this game is a must. My personal thoughts on this game are good, like the realistic waves and controlling the ship.</p>

For example, in the "Der Riese (city map)" you simply have a goal to survive infinite rounds. While in the "Lighthouse" map your mission is to escape it. The character movements feel really sturdy and somewhat real, which in my opinion makes the game also threatening.</p>

    <p>This is one of the older known zombie experiences still played today, because its simple, yet fun. Mission of the game is to survive as many rounds as possible.

    <p>Mount of the Gods is a game where you have to survive on an island, by eating, drinking, staying away from enemies and feeding an altar-like place any resources to get good items next season. There is this system called "seasons" and if in a season timeframe you haven't fed the altar enough, god can do something bad to your island, else you typically get island expansion, which is crucial for survival. I remember playing this and had the fun, but it was also too difficult for me, ended up dying because of not enough resources.</p>

    <p>If you like hide n seek games, this is the first recommendation I would give. Even if hiding and looking sounds too casual, its still a fun experience. You never know what will be the seeker's next move, are they suddenly coming in your way or not. The maps are awesome too - they represent random real life places, typically in houses. Game's function is likely - chooses a random person, others hide and have to survive some minutes.</p>

    <p>Another Roblox survival classic. SBS's has a unique, cartoony style (which is rare these days). Of course, it has a round system with a danger scale indicator, which is chosen before the round and it depends how many players survive - more survive, it increases in difficulty, else the viceversa happens. In the round you are hit with numerous bombs, which even terrorists can't do. Bomb types can vary highly, as some are like nuclear bombs, while others have an explosion radius of a firecracker. Lastly, you can buy powerups with coins and gems, that you get via rounds. I myself have dozens of hours on it and I'll say I would go for 1k.</p>

    <p>First played this back in 2018 and its great. Goal of the game is to survive the other player as a shark who probably is coming to get you and your boat. For defense or even a kill, you can fight back. Its store has sharks, weapons and boats to be bought, which makes the experience richer in choices. Honestly its a 7.5/10 for me. Not perfect because the map feels little bit boring and some players have skill issues as sharks (no offense at all, keep practicing 🤐).</p>

    <p>Discovered this pretty-looking game in 2024. its zombies' souls are not pretty though, because they are there to get you. Your in-round mission can vary - sometimes you need to help someone get to other location, maybe build a vehicle or pack stuff, while theres a hoard of zombies. You can kill them by using your guns n tools that you get to buy. TWR also has a perk system, where you can choose what powers you'll have in rounds. I overall think its a good looking and well made experience. I totally get that some people are disappointed because they thought the game was going to be like a story mode journey, but I still accept the game's structure. Its an 8.5/10 for me.</p>

    <p>PARACAM is a first-person shooting game, where you are stuck in a basement-like habitat. Some weird zombies are living in that habitat and I guess your goal is to eliminate them and keep the place under control by blocking entrances to the monsters. After that your character wants to get out, so this your last goal as I remember. Note that this game can look very different, even in structure as I described, because I played it a year ago.

    <p>Snow Blow Simulator is similar to Snow Shoveling Simulator. It feels like a newer and different version of it. When I mean "newer", i mean that the models look more realistic - especially the vehicles. Your goal is to collect snow, sell it and buy new tools, cars and pets to keep progressing the game. For me the vehicles are fast aswell, which is little bit uncanny and as soon as you reach the fourth area, it gets much harder to progress the game - these are the only complaints I have. Though its still an 8/10 for me - quite satisfying game.I like when you get pro, have a big vehicle, and then some starters get atracted to your vehicle lol.</p>

    <p>An old-looking experience, where your goal is to destroy others ships, get other people to your team or rule an island to keep getting points to win - the game modes can vary. I find it funny and addicting, how you just put a bomb on your enemy ship and watch these real players get obliterated. Typically these players are young, I'm guessing. Pilfering Pirates offers you to buy better boats/planes with the in-game currency. 9/10 for me.</p>

    <p>This is one of the best torando games on Roblox. Even thought I haven't played it much, I can say its also pretty realistic. Primary point of this game are tornadoes and your job is to chase them, but also deploy probes. Bad things can also happen like when the tornado hits you - honestly I have no idea what happens then because I haven't tested it. The graphics are good, vehicles are modeled well and the sounds have nice ambiance. You can buy cars and better probe capacities with the game' cash, which you get by chasing and doing tornado-related tasks.</p>

    <p>A ragdoll game thats all about falling and breaking your bones. You can choose heights, which you get to unlock. Secondly there are upgradeables that make you get more cash. Thirdly there also powerups you can by - gadgets that help you damage your character more. When I started playing it, I had the fun, but it got little bit too grindy after some hours of playing.

    <p>This is another broken bones games where your task is of course to break every dang bone. This is not the official game from Zaquille (the creator of BB IV), but its a fan made one, which does it job well actually. This version looks more modern - it has a cartoony style rather than old Roblox terrain. The upgrades and powerups aren't much different from BBIV as much as I remember, but its still a good alternative if you are tired of Broken Bones IV.</p>

    <p>An absolute Roblox classic gem. I don't think theres a huge number of people who haven't played it yet, its like Roblox's one wing, which makes Roblox feel Roblox. In the game you get to choose what job you want (like cashier, cook, boss, packer, delivery guy) and get money with it. With the money you can upgrade your house and buy furniture. Payouts are quite low if you are starter, but they will increase when working. Waiting or doing tasks makes the top bar level up, which gives you higher payouts, though the process is really slow - to get rich, you need to grind hard as hell. I find an easy 8/10 game. 1 bonus point comes from the goofy cook meme, where you get to be the cook and mess up the kitchen bad (like put yourself or someone into oven).</p>

So for example you start from stone age and later finish in future technology. Not to be agressive, but its fun shooting these people NPCs n throwing bombs. I say its an 8.5 out of 10.</p>

When you are playing it, you collect coins from defeating other player enemies and in turn you get to buy better planes or boats.

    <p>If you are into fps competitive shooters, this is one choice to pick. I find this game dope because the guns are not real guns, they don't shoot straight forward. Instead, you have to aim more up, so you bullets can go further. But no joke, be cautious when you play these type of games. When you have a weak nervous system, its possible players can make you rage quit, just like I have done it several times. Deleting all the madness, its an 8/10 for me.</p>

    <p>This another gem, where your mission is to explore secret places and complete tasks in an underground bunker, which is huge. Over the years the game' map has been expanded quite a bit, because its playerbase never died, so the owner decided to keep fans interested by making them do more tasks and explore new secrets.

    <p>I have played this game for dozens of hours and it didn't get boring due to one single thing - gaining size and rebirths. The game is not flashy and is really simple - you start punching to get power and find orbs that give you that aswell. As you have more power, your character grows and grows in size. There are different character forms that are reached via specific number of power. The last form is 1 million power that makes your character massive. I got addicted rebirthing I remember. Its a pretty dead game now, but it doesn't make the game different in the gameplay - its still fun. 8/10 for me, though I wish the map was expanded atleast. One thing I forgot - you can kill other players too.</p>

    <p>Even though I have only played it once and back in 2022, it was a solid experience. Just like a typical simulator on Roblox is, this game has backpacks, pets, gears etc. You get coins from selling wood and in turn you'll then upgrade your weapons. I put the game here because I found it good and not something that was made for real money. My experience was a 7.5/10 - straightforward game.</p>

    <p>This is a chaotic car game, where you can destroy your or other players cars via collision. Normally the crashes are like bombs, because bunch of explosions come when crashing (especially contacting other players vehicles). Game's money comes from of course, crashes, and with the cash you can buy car hat crates - I find it weird. There's also a level system that makes you unlock new vehicles (there are very few of them), but you first have to earn XP via crashes. Last time I played it, I would have said it was an 8/10.</p>

    <p>This is a game similar to Car Crushers 2, but no crushers and a little bit more buggy experience (which actually make the game great btw). You pick a car and begin driving it, whether its driving normally or crashing it right away. I firt played the game in 2022 and I can say it has evolved for the better, now as I've recently tried it. The damage physics are pretty awesome, but occasionally they are also glitchy (which is typical in this game). There are a collection of maps to choose aswell, so I'll say its a 7.5/10.</p>

    <p>Fundamentally its like Car Crash System but with more details and different maps + cars. I have played it only once and it was in 2022. At the time the physics seemed to be quite okay, though it was laggy and the logic broke sometimes. It has improved tho in the crash system little bit, but the cars remain blocky - which I guess is cool, because it grants the old Roblox charm. I would say its a 7/10.</p>

    <p>Its a game all about tornadoes. It contains lots of different types of tornadoes. Each tornado has their own power, which you have to survive. Most of the time the game is pretty chaotic, especially when the disaster is weird. The game has points too, which you get by completing rounds commonly. With the currency you can buy items that help you survive. Its a nice experience in my opinion, 8/10. Works on low end devices too.</p>

    <p>STK is a round-based killer game, where you get to be a survivor or the killer. If you are survivor, you just need to wait some minutes till the exit opens, and if it opens, you need to run for it to escape. Else you'll be dead. If you are the killer, then your task is just to unalive everybody. You get coins by picking up random items scattered around the place as a survivor, and that's how you get to buy knife skins and house upgrades. Its a good atmosphere game and I like how you don't have any abilities to fight back the killers. Its an 8/10.</p>

    <p>I decided to put this game here because I think its an experience made with pure heart. As I guess the owner is an ocean lover, he decied to make a fish game, where you get to be as a fish, build, and make a family (but its not essential). The game has many fishes to choose from, but mostly you have to unlock them, just by waiting FOREVER litteraly. You get game currency "ages" by waiting and you can also grow your character by eating lobsters. I just find it cute and also nostalgic - definitely made my childhood better. For me, and its only for me, its an 8.5/10.</p>

    <p>When I first played this game, I had the fun. The game is about catching fish, upgrading to better rods and weapons to catch larger, more expensive sea creatures. It has different maps that you get by unlocking them with levels (if I remember correctly). You can also purchase boats to get farther into the ocean - this is where real sharks live and they give great loot. Overall an 8.5/10 artifact.</p>

    <p>This game was litteraly why I started playing Roblox. I have many good memories with it. Infinity RPG is responsible for creating other RPG games, like SHADOVIS RPG, The Legend of The Bone Sword RPG and more. People liked the game, so they decided to make their own version later on. INF. RPG is about fighting monsters, leveling up, getting better armors and swords. in addition there are perk potions, which give you temporary boost - whether its health, XP, damage. For me this is one of the most 2013 Roblox looking games out there and it handles even low end devices. That is why I give it a 9/10.</p>

The gamepasses are not overpriced like these Pet Simulator games have nowadays.

Lastly, people often get a ton of views just by making a video on this game.</p>

    <p>When I first played this, I was immediately in love. This experience is an old-styled Roblox art, where you have to survive multiple disasters and eventually escape via plane or helicopter. There are disasters like tornado, tsunami, blizzard, earthquake, nuclear explosion etc. Game's music is a banger, like an old-school one. It also has a store but you have to travel to it physically, and there you can buy speed/jump coils, parachutes, food and toys. I really like the game's theme and design - 9/10.</p>

    <p>This game is inspired by Survive and Kill The Killers in Area 51. though its not just a version of the original, its a whole different experience. Its layout is different with distinct monsters, you have currency system to buy weapons and mine ores. The reason it has a quite low percentage liking is because the games gets grindy at a certain point and its hard to move forward - and I think they are right, its also my only complaint.</p>

    <p>I remember being addicted to this game. Primary goal in this game is to collect custards, since teletubbies love them. But the problem is that there can be monsters who try to unalive you. Custards need to be collected amount depends on the map, as there are multiple worlds to choose from. Monsters are also players and their types can vary - some are headless, some crawl, others are big and small. Parkouring around while theres a monster chasing you makes it super fun and also scary. That's why I give an easy 9/10.</p>

    <p>This happened to be one of the first games I ever play on Roblox, and to say it was just a great experience. Your task is to build a boat, get through different obstacles of worlds and reach the chest, that gives you a golden block. Nowadays people use bunch of glitches to just grind for gold, to later on build anything they want. I mean this game was originally intended to be like a small challenge, but over the years people started developing method to break the game and start just building stuff. In our modern world BABFT is viewed as a complete sandbox building game, which is true. I really like the game myself, giving it 9.5/10.</p>

    <p>Vehicle Simulator was the first ever car game I would stumble upon on Roblox. Back in 2017 I found it to be addicting and spent dozens of hours on it. The goal is to pick a car, race others or drive around and find secrets (like dominuses, which are nostalgic as FREAK). There's alot of cars to pick, but you have to buy them with the game' cash, which you get from driving and races. I know that SimBuilder went to jail, but I still think the game is absolutely great. He wasn't lying that he was the inventor of modern Roblox cars imo - before that game, every car had sturdy steering system and their physics were weird. For me its 9/10.</p>

    <p>The Rake is a good survival horror experience that is handled even by low-end devices. In there, your mission is to simply survive the night with Rake roaming around. You get points via picking up scraps and selling them to a local shop, or by surviving the night. With the points you can buy gadgets like bullet vest, stun stick, map etc. The experience is a top tier when you war headphones, because it makes you hear alot better whats going on there, which creates a scary experience. Its an 8.5/10 for me. I also like when theres a squad beating up The Rake - its goofy.</p>

    <p>You may have never heard of this game but I'mma tell ya. Its very similar to The Rake - you spawn in a random place and your objective is to survive the night while theres a creature called "Dover Demon". This is a cryptid monster which originates from USA. Currently the game doesn't have a shop system where you can spend points, but you do get cash and items. The game looks beautiful overall, the map and even the monster - creature looks quite scary. For me its an EASY 8.5/10.</p>

    <p>If you like memes, this is the game to play. Its like a second variant of The Rake. This time you have a different map design, more tools and even foods + drinks that keep you alive if you are damaged. The movements are faster than the original game, specifically running. The killer (RakOOF) has a noob NPC design with its white eyes, and its there to slash you. Surviving the night gives you points and you can also find golden coins that you can use in vending machines to buy consumables. Its not super creepy, but its quite fun - 7.5/10.</p>

    <p>This is another survival horror, where there is a Michael Jackson-looking character running around the map. If it sees you, its coming to get your cheeks. As of 2025, this game doesn't really have a goal at all - you just wander around, collect items found in buildings, use your starter tracker and try to bully Ayuwoki. People often play it because they find it fun to be in a group of people trying to escape the creature. For me, its a 7/10, I like the way Ayuwoki constantly screams "he hee!".</p>

I say this game is like a modern version of the first game, where there are more animations and the map looks more alive with its colors. The core idea is basic - serve customers, buy better tools, more land + tables and get rich. I have played it more than RT1 because I found it more addicting because of its mechanics and graphics.

One downside is that you have to wait quite for some time to buy that next thing - wish they gave you more cash.

    <p>A game where you take a car and drive it down a hill (but not always, there are upward driving points too). The farher you get, the more cash you make. The cash is used to purchase better, more robust vehicles that handle more hits from obstacles. The game has many different hill world sections which I like. Its an 8/10.</p>

    <p>Taxi Boss is a game all about cars and people. You are a taxi driver and have to pick up people in order to generate money. The game offers to buy better cars, so you can pick up people who want fancy, luxurious environment while traveling. You can also buy houses and garages, which are pretty pointless as I remember correctly - they are just for aesthetic, flex purposes. I have played the game and even got the best, most luxurious car, but the grind got also repetitive to achieve it. Note that its been 3 years since I played this for that long, so it means the game has probably much more content to it. In summary its an 8/10.</p>

    <p>Interliminality is a backrooms-based game, where are bunch of different levels that you have to pass. Some of the levels contain monsters, who are probably trying to get you. Its not always about just running around, but you also have to find items sometimes to get out from a level. I find this game cool, because the devs have put like a story to the game aswell. The monsters are unique and quite well designed, which is a bonus point for me. I have played this alone and also with my friend, where we both found it to be an immersive experience. So, easy 8/10.</p>

It has quie some haters because the game has bugs and gets too grindy, but besides the hate its a nostalgic game about your dealership and cars. The cars work well and the game' mechanics too. You get money by driving around and if I remember correctly, there are also races that bring lots of money. That way you can buy better cars and upgrade your dealership to generate more income. The experience is a 7/10.</p>

    <p>Its a car game where your goal is to simply get the car you want, and I guess to get rich aswell. You pick a starter car, drive around to discover places, do races and get cash. With the money you can upgrade your machine or buy a better vehicle. When I played it, I mostly did only races rather than romaing around and still liked the game. I'd say it fits to be an 8.5/10 car game.</p>

    <p>If you are looking for a Lumber Tycoon 2 alternative, this is the choice to pick. This shares a similar core idea as LT2, where you get wood to make cash, and with the cash you buy better clean wood makers and other helper tools (especially axes). I find this game awesome because not only you get to chop wood, but also mine stone and ores, which in turn you can make buildings with these. Its overall a more complex machine creating experience, and when I played it, I was immediately leaned into the game by its design and idea. Its a good one - 8.5/10.</p>

    <p>A game where you land on a special planet and want to place a flag on it, but the problem is that there are alien-like monsters trying to protect it or even kill you. So you have to unalive them by shooting with you primary/secondary gun and also a grenade which is effective. If you manage to defeat all monsters, you get a boss who is typically pretty strong. If you complete the mission, you get cash, and with it you can buy boxes where you need to have luck to get a good weapon - its an RNG. When I visited the game, I did like it quite alot.

I find that difficulty chart obby different due to its older age and pure originality. It was made by a person who wanted to make something for practicing your timing and precision skills. The game's design is okay and I guess it doesn't need more. The difficulty levels are well done and playable, but remember, it gets really hard at the end. I like the music - there are only like 2 repetitive songs, which could be improved by adding more. For me its a 7/10.</p>

    <p>One of the most controversial games on Roblox is Jailbreak, because some people say its bad and others think its good. I overall think its still a great ahh game, especially looking back at 2016-2020. Game' structure is that you get to pick to be a criminal or police. If you are police, your job is to catch criminal. If a criminal, your job is to get out of the prison, start robbing places that have valuables and eventually sell them in secret spots. You can buy weapons and fast cars to feel safer. Vehicles are upgradeable, you can customize and mount better systems that make your machine faster. Over the years the game has gotten more fictional vehicles, which kind of ruins the game imo. The playerbase is often toxic aswell. So, because of that I will give it 7/10.</p>

    <p>SCP: Roleplay is one of the best structurally styled SCP games on Roblox. In this experience you can choose to be a prisoner or facility-related dudes like guards.

To escape the facility, there are some secret tunnels for example, and you can escape with helicopter. If you are a guard, your job is to not let any prisoners escape. The map is big and you can do other random stuff too + there are actual SCPs too, though I havent seen them. Its a 7.5/10 for me.</p>

    <p>This is a survival horror game, where you have to survive the night. The map is a sparse forested terrain and it also contains full buildings, where you can find codes that open a container. The container has a rifle inside and is used to do bad things to The Skinwalker. When I played this, it took me forever to find all the codes. Eventually I did find them all, got the rifle and turned out you need to be a much higher level to buy bullets... It pissed me off and made me from liking the game to meh. I still find this game as love-driven built experience, but it gets grindy if you want to get to shoot the rifle. I like the creature, terrain and construction design, but I spent hours on it, just achieve nothing. I even made a video on it on AntiTd channel. 6.5/10.</p>

    <p>Not really a game, but an ideal way to get visits to your own creations. Developer Hub is somewhat popular spot to gain views to your games but it takes alot of waiting, because as of 2025 there are not alot active players. The way it works is that you choose your best games (in your opinion) and put them on big posters for people to see who walk by. Its like a big mall place where you are - I do like the design of it. I have used it and it somewhat works but not that effective. The core idea is inventional though - get more visits to your games without sponsoring. Only if it had much more players, it would be an effective tool. For me its a 7/10.</p>

    <p>In my opinion its one of the best firework games on Roblox. In this experience, you can buy fireworks, terrain bombs and even tools that give advantages to firework systems, (for example connect multiple fireworks to ignite them at the same time). You can hold a total of 9 different items in your Minecraft-like inventory system. There are a ton of various fireworks and the dev. is still adding more and more of them, but some are also limited, so if you don't buy them with R$, they'll be gone forever mostly. The overall game design is cartoony and has a nice city map with beach. There also secrets to be found, which give you money - but players mostly get cash via launching fireworks. I find the experience addicting - 8.5/10.</p>

    <p>For me this an absolute gem because I played it back in 2018 and found it quite satisfying. The game' purpose is to bonk NPCs with a hammer and complete quests. With bans you can buy more robust hammers to in turn get more bans from each NPC kill. BHS has a decent structure, like terrain and buildings. So, that's litteraly the whole game lol, but I find it dope because its banner hammers and also a minimalistic simulation game. It deserves a score of 8/10.</p>

    <p>When I was younger I would quit the game for 2 reasons - I got all the items I need or rage quit. In that game, your job is to rule the world with powers. You simply have to wait for the lucky blocks to be available again - depending on the block tier, it takes 1 to 60 minutes. Players are your biggest enemies though - some kids can get uncool with you and start taking the L. Thats why this game exists, its your task to destroy them in every aspect. Terrain design also looks like old Roblox, so that makes me want to give it an overall score of 7.5/10.</p>

    <p>One of the most simple 10M+ visit simulator games on Roblox. You spawn in as a chicken and your goal is just to get as big as possible. You get growth by pecking eggs of the ground and theres also a change you find a golden egg, which gives you a much larger number of growth. That is the whole game and I for some reason found it cool back in 2018. I still think its nice to include this game here, because its old Roblox and it was made 4 fun.

I didn't play it much aswell, so it might be even better as i described - remember, it was years ago when I played it and I got positive memories from the game.

    <p>One of the best looking car crash games on 2025 Roblox. Instead of using block parts, this uses pure softbody-like physics (but its not actually softbody, idk what it is). You can choose from a variety of cars for free, but there are JDM and other special car gamepasses that are not too pleading. Overall this experience feels like we are leaning towards a new era on Roblox, the future era. Easy 7/10 for me because even if it has quite bad crashes (like the cars driving through your car), it still gives a spectation of what we could be capable of achieving in a complete blocky game Roblox.</p>

    <p>This a game where you are always a shark, and your target is to evolve into a stronger one. You get evolve XP by fighting other sea creatures, but also I remember you can buy pets with some kind of coins. As you thought, pets speed up your evolving. The overall game's structure is similar to Pet Simulator, where you are in one area and to get to the next area, you need to buy or just reach enough XP to unlock it. I find this gridny but passable, so its a 6.5/10.</p>

    <p>Pressure is a game, that's structure and mechanics are similar to DOORS. In this experience, you still go through doors to reach rooms, but the rooms are more creative and more spacey. Sometimes you have to go underwater to reach the next room and I find that cool. The monsters are decent looking, sound effects are strawberry, and the room builds look awesome, futuristic. If someone wanted me to rate this, I would give it an 8.5/10.</p>

    <p>This is a NASCAR racing game, where your task is just to drive and beat other players. The physics are quite dope in my opinon. Your machine can go to a flight due to crash or imbalanced gravity, just like in the real NASCAR racing world. Even though glitchy, your vehicle can get absolutely destroyed into pieces with the game' constraints and hinges logic. As said, bugs do occur but I find it really fun, especially with other players when you are driving fast and everyone starts crashing - its an absolute chaos. Overall score is 8.5/10. Forgot to mention - you can pick cars from different eras aswell.</p>

    <p>Its another zombie game where your task is to simply kill the undead and raise money for upgrades. The unique thing about is experience is that you get permanent cash from shooting zombies, but also the in-round money from shooting zombs again. Permanenet cash is used to upgrade your weapons, which save and stay with you forever, while the in-round cash is used to purchase power perks (similar to Call of Duty Zombies). You can also build gadgets like sentry guns that kill zombies for you. In short, ZU is a fantastic undead killing game and I would like to give it a 9/10.</p>

Then just start running to collect rings, which are used to purchase pets that multiply your cash and XP earnings, while there are also trails that you give you extra XP. You can unlock new worlds by having enough levels. More levels increase your speed and jump power. Lastly, there are quests too, which can give you new characters, but some of them are also found in events and some secret places. When I played it, I did have the fun - 9/10.</p>

    <p>One of the most known tycoons on Roblox is War Tycoon, which is all about war. In there, your job is to build a robust base full of armory and protect it. If it feels like you are prepared enough, you can begin traveling into middle of the map and take down other player's flag and place yours. Why? - because it gives you money passively due to city ruling purposes, and someone takes down their flag, they rule it. The game has alot of stuff like planes, helicopters, ships, boats, guns etc. I give it a 9/10.</p>

    <p>ERLC is a more realistic Roblox experience, where you can choose to be an officer, citizen, fire trucker and more. The whole point of this game is to basically do your task, like officer needs to catch criminals, firefighter has to put fire out and as a citizen you could be a criminal but not needed. If you are a citizen, you have many options: like choosing what car to drive, what house to own, whether you want to do shady stuff, then go ahead. You can buy criminal tools (lockpicks, ATM cards etc) in the hardware shop. You can get into trouble if your ATM hacking fails - the police will try to get you. There are alot more stuff in this game what to talk about, but this review gets too lengthy. Score? - 8.5/10.k</p>

    <p>The reason I put this here is because it was made with passion and its design looks what elderly Roblox is. Obby's story is simple: You spawn in a castle and your job is to escape it, but just with some obstacles. I like the stone wallpaper design of the castle (lol), and also rooms that have lava - the lava is more realistic looking than 90% of parkour games. I think its a nice little game when you have little bit of time to spend, so it is a 7/10.</p>

    <p>Oobja is kind of like an obby game that's emotional. When you start the game, you spawn very high up in the sky with clouds. Your task is to parkour around a big wall and then walk straight. You'll sometime later meet a sphere called Oobja, who is giving you heart warming messages. Eventually the game ends after the talk is done, but before the ending, you get an UGC item on your screen, encouraging you to purchase it... The game doesn't feel all that nice to me because of that, but I still give it a 7.5/10.</p>

    <p>A game where your goal is to get a snack at 4am (as the title already says it). At the start of the game you wake up from bed and your stomach feels empty. Your character wants food, so you have to get a snack, but there are obstacles you need to avoid. You can get bad endings where you never get the snack, (for example waking up your dad, eating the wrong thing). When you eat the right snack though, you get the good ending. There are more endings to the game in addition. I remember I played it and seemed to like the environment of the experience, but it offered me frustration due to its "what this button does?" system - you could mess up easily. Its still a flowing 8.5/10.</p>

    <p>At the start of the game it looks like a normal, cartoony appearing obby with a basic difficulty chart system. Theres a noob teaching you how to pass the stages. As you move forward, the game gets weirder. For example the sky turns black, VHS-like screen starts appearing and the whole world is going to turn red slowly. But pay attention - this is not the right ending if you want a good one. To get better endings, you have to find secret passages and not take action as the noob tells you. I find it a cool game, but I only got one bad ending. Later looked it up on YT and found out how awesome the game is. Its an 8.5/10 - not too creepy, while being mysterious.</p>

    <p>This is an obby where you are a man-like bird (in my opinion lol) and your task is to parkour at the very top of the mountain. The mountain is huge and you have to pass its obstacles, be precise enough to jump onto right spots and avoid falling accidentally when you are close to a break. Obyab uses stud bricks, which is a late styling trend on Roblox that makes people feel more nostalgia, compared to these smooth parts. I think the developer is a genius - just make the gravitation less powerful and boom, it feels like you are somewhat flying. I like these type of obbies - 8/10.</p>

    <p>This experience was built on top of Da Hood - a game that's filled with toxic ahh players. Surprisingly when I at least played it, the playerbase was not that bad, like where they try to always bully you. Its more about killing others to steal items from the bank for example. Rich dudes will play 4 fun and mess around. The game' purpose is drive people who want GTA-like games but without overly toxic fanbase. You can buy weapons, rob buildings, contact players with your phone and buy houses, (at least I remember someone showed me their house). Its a good one, better than DH. I like the name of the game too, so 7.5/10.</p>

    <p>Tsunami Game is a unique one compared to other tsunami disaster experiences, because instead of being like a disaster made by earth, this time its actually made by people. The tsunamis are made by waiting a little bit and pressing a red button. The longer you wait, the bigger the tsunami will be. Your task is to simply reach the end - a forward walk simulation like Squid Game, but with Tsunamis to watch out. If the Wave is too big, you have to find a cave and be there, unless you want to get pushed back to the beginning. If you win, you get points and with these you can buy items like boat, surfing board, a whole dang tree house and much more. It does grab your attention and for me its a 7.5/10.</p>

    <p>This is a horror game where you take your flashlight + camera (although not needed) and go jump into a random hole in a cave that makes you fall down like multiple stories. Now you are in a cave and there are 2 monsters that you have to survive as long as possible. Why? - Because sadly this game was never fully developed and meant to be more like a demo. That's why theres randomly a level and an axe, which were meant to be part of the finished full game. Though, its said that its still being finished as of 2025, with cutscenes and an actual ending. So thats awesome. The creatures' names are Cajoler (small mask guy) and Orotund (tall skeleton), who are just there to get your cheeks. Just avoid them or even better - bully them, like throw rocks at them lol. In conclusion its a solid 7/10.</p>

    <p>This is a story mode game where all objects are in 3D but you can see everything in a 2D perspective - its unique. Primary goal of this game is to beat the bad guys and complete quests. It feels almost like a real life experience where you have to move on, but with different goals like defeating the enemies. When you kill opponents, you sometimes get new swords that are needed to fight coming up foes. You also have a bouncy ball, which is used to throw at foe. I really like this experience because its story is well done and the build's structure is fantastic - 9.5/10.</p>

    <p>A 2016 game made by the developer of Build a Boat For Treasure. Your mission there is to protect your castle, upgrade your weapon system, build gadgets + protection and survive the rounds, (not only castle but you aswell). Cash is of course gotten from shooting slimes, which you can use to buy upgrades to your bow or weapons. The last wave is 25th and if you can survive that, you are essentially the winner of ROTS. I find it awesome, because this game was actually inspired by a 2008 version made by JustinP231's. 8.5/10.</p>

    <p>This is a game released in 2025 July and is an official sequel to REVENGE OF THE SLIMES!!!. The game has 15 rounds, where each round you have to shoot slimes to defend your own custom built structure, instead of an existing castle. If slimes get too far, they'll start damaging your base and after that they target you. After all players are dead, its a game over. So level up to unlock stronger blocks/gadgets, own new weapons to take health from slimes fast and have a genius base structure idea. To me its an 8.5/10 - looks nicely polished and the gameplay is fun.</p>

    <p>Primal Pursuit's core idea is similar to SharkBite. You get a vehicle for escaping and weaponry for defending, and you have to wait some minutes to survive the round by escaping via helicopter. The game contains numerous amount of maps and dinosaurs aswell. If you win the round, you get teeth that you can use to purchase weapons, dinos, vehicles and even powerups/round-kickers that make beating rounds possibly easier. I find this game cool, its design and sound effects. An easy 8.5/10.</p>

    <p>This is another old-school styled brick parkour, where your job is to reach higher spots gradually. Even though its again used these basic LEGO dotted parts, they are put well together in designing different areas. You use your ladder to get across bumps and bridges all the time, which can be intimidating. Luckily it does have break sites and checkpoints, so you don't lose all your progress if you were to fall for example. I find STEEP STEPS relaxing, while also being a sweaty af gamer at intense parts. So its an 8 out of 10.</p>

    <p>FM is a Five Nights At Freddy's game, that's gameplay mechanics are quite different from just sitting in your chair and checking cameras. If you choose the main 5 nights mode, in the game you have to close the curtains to keep the puppet away, pull lever to get back oxygen levels and also go turn the power back on if its low or out. Else golden freddy will get you. Each night a new animatronic wakes up and begins to roam around the building, meaning it gets crispy. Most people call others to complete nights with teamwork. When i played it with other players, they often didn't know what to do and it made me feel hopeless. But it doesn't mean finding good players is impossible - just put dedication to it. I rate the game 8.5/10.</p>

    <p>For some reason I find this game hard to explain. Its something about making decisions in life and whether they are bad or good depends on your own thoughts. It shows you tales that most of the time show unsettling, dark and mysterious situations. The game let's you to solve puzzles, but you have to think critically to do them - its about making choices. The sound design is great and makes some feel uncomfortable a bit, but the places' structures are well done - its minimalism feels like its all you need. There are no "good" or "bad" endings, but a message saying that you made decisions and got through it. To me the game is pure art and these type of real life experiences are uncommon on Roblox, so its an easy 9/10.</p>

    <p>Now I have no idea why the name is "100 Player Sledding", because the server is is 35, not 100. I also might be getting it wrong. I actually put this on the list because of its simple but fun, especially with other players. You get a shed by building it, by carrying some parts to it, and eventually it will be ready to use. Mechanics are so simple during sliding that you only need to steer you sled. I have no idea what happens if you beat this whole thing - you can try it out yourself. I'll put that experience a score of 7/10 - graphics are simple and the game doesn't have a currency system, which is rare in these type of games.</p>

    <p>This is a place where you can build any vehicle you would like, to run drive it on the moon. The building system is quite advanced and sometimes causes frustration for beginners, but they will get the hang of it. You get money by carrying and delivering crates, which indeed, are used to buy more stuff. There's level scheme too, that when you level up, you gain 1 skill point - this is used to upgrade your vehicle's capabilities and also your character's. I find it unique and relaxing at the same time - 8/10.</p>
