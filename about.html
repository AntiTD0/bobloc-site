<div class="about">
<h1>Brother what is this site about?</h1>
<p>The website was made to show games, 
    accessories and other stuff that I like on Roblox. 
    Even though I'm not into some artifacts as much as others 
    here, I still have to put them, because they were made 
    mostly out of passion and fun. I do allow sometimes games to put these AI-like generated thumbnails for robux earning purposes, but only if experiences are mostly coded by real humans, where they create uniqueness, originality and keep the game appropriate. This way, their robux asking is for future development purposes to keep developers motivated and create more awesome games. But not people who are aiming to make like 10 million robux from a brainrot ahh game, putting AI work into them and become like millionaires - that's greedy and evil, because you are making new generation kids dumber, litteraly. So thats said, I like to put things into this website that I see as creative, work-put and old Roblox comebackers, which don't turn players into full lobotomized robots - grinding on a game that's meant to steal your R$. The same goes to public UGC accessories. Items like fake valkyries are cringe and not good for long term investment. TL:DR - Picking artifacts from Roblox that feel right.</p>
